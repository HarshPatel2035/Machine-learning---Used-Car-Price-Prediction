# ðŸš— Used Car Price Prediction (Regression) â€“ Machine Learning Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts the **selling price of used cars** based on various features such as year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and more.  
The model uses **XGBoost Regression**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Build a machine learning model that predicts car prices with high accuracy.
- Understand the impact of different features on the final price.
- Deploy the trained model for practical usage (optional future enhancement).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains information about used cars, including:
- **Car Name** â€“ Model name of the car.
- **Year** â€“ Manufacturing year.
- **Selling Price** â€“ Target variable (price in lakhs).
- **Present Price** â€“ Price when the car was new.
- **Kms Driven** â€“ Total kilometers driven.
- **Fuel Type** â€“ Petrol/Diesel/CNG.
- **Seller Type** â€“ Dealer/Individual.
- **Transmission** â€“ Manual/Automatic.
- **Owner** â€“ Number of previous owners.

> The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - pandas, numpy â€“ Data processing
  - matplotlib, seaborn â€“ Data visualization
  - scikit-learn â€“ Preprocessing, train-test split, evaluation
  - XGBoost â€“ Machine learning regression model
  - Jupyter Notebook â€“ Development environment

## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Loaded dataset for used cars.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaned and transformed data for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualized data patterns and correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Encoded categorical variables and handled outliers.
5. **Model Building** â€“ Implemented XGBoost Regression.
6. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Evaluated model performance using RÂ² Score, MAE, and RMSE.
7. **Prediction** â€“ Predicted car prices for new/unseen data.

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance
| Metric      | Score |
|-------------|-------|
| RÂ² Score    | 0.89  |
| MAE         | 4099.05 |
| RMSE        | 6238.48  |
